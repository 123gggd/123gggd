# Hi, I'm Chengyang 👋

I'm a Python Automation Developer focused on solving real-world business data problems.

While I have a strong background in Full-stack Vue development (see my repository nebulapuls8888), my current freelance focus is strictly on Python Automation & Data workflows.

I build scripts to clean messy Excel/CSV files, validate data before import, and sync records between SaaS platforms using APIs.

---

## What I Do

- Automate Excel and CSV data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Build pre-import data validation tools  
- Sync data between SaaS platforms (CRM, accounting systems, Google Sheets)  
- Replace manual workflows and Zapier automations with Python scripts  
- Build lightweight API integrations between business systems  

---

## Typical Problems I Solve

- Messy CSV exports that fail during CRM or ERP import  
- Duplicate or conflicting records in Excel files  
- Broken data syncs between SaaS tools  
- Manual copy-paste workflows between spreadsheets and CRMs  
- High Zapier costs for simple data automation  

---

## Example Use Cases

- Clean and deduplicate contact lists before CRM import  
- Sync Google Sheets data to a CRM via REST API  
- Validate Excel files and generate error reports  
- Merge multiple CSV files into a clean master dataset  
- Build scheduled automation scripts for reporting  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas  
- REST APIs, JSON  
- Google Sheets API  
- Web scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup)  

---

## Current Focus

Building Python automation tools for:

- CRM data imports  
- Accounting and invoicing data sync  
- Reporting and Excel automation  
- SaaS integrations without Zapier
